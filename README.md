# Final-report
This is a summary of work done by during a research method course.
It containes work with Arthrospira platensis and some exercises to study new research methods.

Mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems presents significant environmental and health challenges, with ethylmercury and methylmercury being particularly toxic forms that bioaccumulate and biomagnify through the food web. This research aims to explore the potential of Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis), a cyanobacterium recognized for its nutritional value and environmental resilience, to accumulate mercury salts and transfer them to mussels. The study will involve cultivating Spirulina in controlled conditions, exposing it to ethylmercury and methylmercury, and subsequently feeding it to mussels to observe the transfer of mercury. We hypothesize that Spirulina can effectively accumulate these mercury salts and that mussels fed with mercury-laden Spirulina will show increased mercury concentrations. The research methodology includes cultivating Spirulina, preparing mercury solutions, exposing Spirulina to these solutions, acclimating mussels, and conducting feeding experiments followed by mercury analysis. Preliminary results suggest Spirulina's capability to grow in mercury-spiked media and potentially accumulate mercury. This study will provide insights into the role of Spirulina in bioremediation of mercury-contaminated waters, contributing to environmental management practices aimed at reducing mercury levels in aquatic ecosystems and protecting both aquatic life and human health. The research will span over eight months, involving background research, experimental setup, data collection and analysis, and report preparation.
