## Protocol for growing Spirulina
## Climatic Factors
*Optimum growth temperature:* **35°C**  
*Growth ceases below 20°C and above 38°C*  
*Light:* **30% of full sunlight is ideal; avoid prolonged strong illumination**  
*Agitate culture to prevent prolonged exposure to full sunlight*  

## Culture Medium Preparation
**Example composition:**  
- **Sodium carbonate:** 5 g/L  
- **Sodium chloride:** 5 g/L  
- **Potassium nitrate:** 2 g/L  
- **Sodium bicarbonate:** 1 g/L  
- **Potassium sulfate:** 1 g/L  
- **Urea:** 0.02 g/L  
- **Monoammonium phosphate:** 0.1 g/L  
- **Magnesium sulfate:** 0.2 g/L  
- **Lime:** 0.02 g/L  
- **Ferrous sulfate:** 0.005 g/L  

## Seeding
Use a spirulina strain with high coiled filaments and high gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) content.  
Maintain culture at a concentration of 0.3 g/L after dilution.  

## Growing Conditions
Keep the culture depth between 10 and 20 cm.  
Maintain culture medium's pH around 10.4 by adding CO2 or bicarbonate as needed.  
Provide continuous or regular agitation.  

## Harvesting
1. **Filtration:**  
   - Use fine weave cloth (30-50 microns).  
   - Filter the culture using gravity.  
   - Support filtration cloth with a net to protect from rupturing.
2. **Dewatering:**  
   - Press biomass to remove residual culture medium.  
   - Use a strong cotton cloth and apply pressure with a heavy object for about 15 minutes.  

## Drying
- Extrude biomass into rods (1-2 mm diameter) and dry on a plastic perforated tray.
- Protect from contamination and limit drying temperature to 68°C for up to 7 hours.
- Final product should have less than 9% water content.

## Feeding the Culture
Add nutrients to maintain medium fertility:  
- **Urea:** 300 g/kg of harvested spirulina  
- **Monoammonium phosphate:** 50 g/kg  
- **Potassium sulfate:** 30 g/kg  
- **Magnesium sulfate:** 30 g/kg  
- **Lime:** 10 g/kg  
- **Iron sulfate:** 2.5 g/kg  
- **Micronutrients solution:** 5 ml/kg (optional)  

## Maintenance
- Regularly agitate the culture.
- Compensate for evaporation with clean water.
- Manage pH and salinity to avoid undesirable exopolysaccharide (EPS) production.
- Monitor for contaminants and renew culture medium as necessary.

Why 16S rRNA is a Good Reference Gene for qPCR:
1. Highly Conserved Sequence:
The 16S rRNA gene has a highly conserved sequence across different species, including Arthrospira platensis. This conservation ensures that the gene's expression is stable and reliable for comparison across various experimental conditions.

2. Essential Cellular Function:
As a component of the ribosomal RNA, the 16S rRNA gene is crucial for protein synthesis in the ribosome. Its fundamental role in cellular function means its expression levels remain relatively constant, regardless of external conditions or treatments.

# R Data Analysis of Photosurvey

The goal of this analysis is to investigate and comprehend how the presence of algae is influenced by seasons, depths, and years. The data was processed using R, and various statistical analyses were performed to determine the significance of these factors.

## Let's look at the presence of algae:

![Algae presence](../images//algae-season-depth.png)

As we can see, there is more algae presence at 10 and 25 meters. This is understandable because algae depend on sunlight. We should also mention that algae have the highest representation and were found in all samples (the lowest was at 45 meters and was estimated as 0.48 - you can notice the small blue dot at the edge of the X vector). Also, we can notice that seasons don't affect algae much.

### Kruskal-Wallis Test

Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 87.592, df = 2, p-value < 2.2e-16

Since the p-value is far less than any commonly used significance level, this means there is extremely strong evidence to suggest that the distributions of algae presence are significantly different across the different depths. This indicates that depth has a significant effect on the presence of algae.

## For comparison, let's look at the representation of the lowest taxonomic group, Mollusca.

![Mollusca year](../images/depth%20+%20seson.png)

In comparison to algae, Mollusca have a very sparse presence, only in 4 measurements! This makes up 1.17% of total measurements. This also explains why we have so much algae, as many Mollusca species are herbivores, and their presence might reduce algae.

## Let's analyze the sites.

![Algae site](../images/site-algae.png)
 
We can see clearly that in the Achziv site, the presence of algae is higher, especially at lower depths. Algae need a proper substrate to attach to, so Achziv might have better conditions for algae or less pressure from herbivores. Let's check this theory by comparing the presence of algae with echinodermata.

![Algae site](../images/algae-echinoderma.png)

As we can see, there is some competition between these two taxonomic groups, but due to a lack of data, we can't be sure. Let's also check Bryozoa; maybe the competition for substrate is higher than the prey-predator connection.

![Algae site](../images/algae-Bryozoa.png)

And yes! We see a strong correlation between these two groups, let's do a Kruskal-Wallis Test.

### Kruskal-Wallis Test

Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 255.54, df = 170, p-value = 2.392e-05

Since the p-value is far less than any commonly used significance level, this means there is strong evidence to suggest that the distributions of algae presence are significantly different across the different levels of Bryozoa. This indicates that Bryozoa has a significant effect on the presence of algae.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis indicates that depth, site conditions, and the presence of other taxonomic groups significantly influence the distribution of algae. Depth plays a crucial role, with more algae presence at shallower depths due to the dependency on sunlight. The site-specific analysis suggests that environmental factors and the presence of herbivores like Mollusca and competitors like Bryozoa and Echinodermata affect algae distribution.

# Metabolomics analysis
Here is an analysis of a metabolomics of a antibiotic Negamycin.

As we can see one molecule has a mass difference 17.027. I have a theory that this molecule has an additional hydroxyl group.
